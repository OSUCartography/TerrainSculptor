The size in megabytes of a grid is:
cells x rows x 4 / 1024 /1024

Terrain Sculptor is caching 
• 1 originalGrid
• 1 detailedGrid (if original grid contains void values)
• 1 slopeGrid
• 7 cached results of  intermediate steps
• 2 temporary grids (from grid pool) 
• 1 image (same size as grids) with 2 bytes per pixel
• 4 intermediate grids for display (final result, ridges, valleys, combination mask) if different from cached results of work packages

Maximum grids: 16 grids
plus one image

The required memory for a grid with 5000 x 5000 cells is:
5000 x 5000 x 4 / 1024 / 1024 x 16.5 = 1573 MB
6753 x 10600 x 4 / 1024 / 1024 x 16.5 = 4505 MB

Or approximately
cells x rows / 15000
