Terrain Sculptor 2.0

http://terraincartography.com/terrainsculptor/

This is a standalone version of Terrain Sculptor 2.0 for Netbeans 7. All required source files are included in a single project. External libraries are in ./lib/

Text encoding of all files is MacRoman. The source requires Java SDK 8 or higher.

A Windows EXE file is automatically created at the end of the ANT build process using launch4j (see ./win/). A Mac OS X application is created by copying the final JAR into a predefined application package (see ./mac/).
