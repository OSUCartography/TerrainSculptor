/**
 * From the SUN Tutorial "How to Use Icons"<br>
 * 
 * The first argument to the ImageIcon constructor is relative to the location of
 * the class, and will be resolved to an absolute URL. The description argument is
 * a string that allows assistive technologies to help a visually impaired user
 * understand what information the icon conveys.<br>
 * 
 * Generally, applications provide their own set of images used as part of the
 * application, as is the case with the images used by many of our demos. You
 * should use the Class getResource method to obtain the path to the image.
 * This allows the application to verify that the image is available and to provide
 * sensible error handling if it is not. When the image is not part of the
 * application, getResource should not be used and the ImageIcon constructor is
 * used directly. For example: <br>
 * <code>
 * ImageIcon icon = new ImageIcon("/home/sharonz/images/middle.gif",
 *                               "a pretty but meaningless splat");
 * </code>
 * <br>
 * When you specify a filename or URL to an ImageIcon constructor, processing
 * is blocked until after the image data is completely loaded or the data location
 * has proven to be invalid. If the data location is invalid (but non-null), an
 * ImageIcon is still successfully created; it just has no size and, therefore,
 * paints nothing. As we showed in the loadImageIcon method, it's wise to first
 * verify that the URL points to an existing file before passing it to the
 * ImageIcon constructor.
